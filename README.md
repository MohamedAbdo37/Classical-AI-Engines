# Classical-AI-Engines
This repository contains implementations of classical AI engines for four board games: 8-puzzle, Connect-4, Chess, and Maze. These engines are developed using Java as part of an Introduction to AI course. Each game uses different AI strategies and algorithms tailored to the problem domain.
