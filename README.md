# Classical-AI-Engines
This repository contains implementations of classical AI engines for four board games: 8-puzzle, Connect-4, Chess, and Maze. These engines are developed using Java as part of an Introduction to AI course. Each game uses different AI strategies and algorithms tailored to the problem domain.

## Overview
This repository is part of an Introduction to AI course project where we (a team of students) are building classical AI engines for four distinct board games:
- **8-puzzle**

Each engine is implemented in Java and demonstrates different AI strategies, such as search algorithms and decision-making methods tailored to each game.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into four main folders, one for each game engine:
- `8-puzzle/`: Contains the AI engine for solving the 8-puzzle game.
- `Connect-4/`: Implements an AI engine for playing Connect-4.
- `Chess/`: Houses the AI engine for playing Chess.
- `Maze/`: Contains the AI engine for solving various maze configurations.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode) for Java development

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedAbdo37/Classical-AI-Engines.git
