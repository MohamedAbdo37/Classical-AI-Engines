# Classical-AI-Engines - 8-Puzzle

## Overview
This repository is part of an Introduction to AI course project where we (a team of students) are building classical AI engines for four distinct board games, starting with the **8-puzzle**. This project demonstrates AI strategies and algorithms using JavaFX for a user-friendly interface.

## Project Structure
The repository is organized into multiple packages for clarity:
- **`environment/`**: Contains the `EnvironmentState` class that manages the state of the 8-puzzle board.
- **`ui/`**: Contains the `PuzzleUI` class, which handles the JavaFX user interface.
- **`algorithms/`**: Implements different solving algorithms. The `Engine` interface defines the primary method for these algorithms.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later
- Gradle 6.0 or later
- An IDE or text editor (e.g., IntelliJ, Eclipse, VSCode) for Java development

## Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/MohamedAbdo37/Classical-AI-Engines.git
